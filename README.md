# JavaScript Quiz Game

My motivation for this project was to learn more about programming in Javascript, and it was quite the journey!

This project was done to learn more about how Javascript can interact with the DOM and how to manipulate the DOM via Javascript via Web APIs.

No code was provided for this project, so it was a "greenfield" type of experience. While challenging, it was also very engaging and fun to utilize new skills.
